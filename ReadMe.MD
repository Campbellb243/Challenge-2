In this project, I was to organize stock data using Excel VBA. In the data set, you are able to see each ticker organized with the annual changes. You can see the successful and failing stocks of each year. The successful stocks are set to be green while the failing stocks are red, this is the same in each sheet. I was able to work with Nithya-TKDR, slack overflow, Microsoft Learn, WallStreetMojo, Automate Excel, and GeeksforGeeks. With this project, I learned many different functions and how to create different types of loops. Not only did I learn all the loops that worked in the sheet, but I learned many loops that weren't applicable here but may be in other future projects. I'm very grateful for the UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp and all of the teachers and leaders that have helped answer my many many questions. Matt Bosworth and Ardavan Karbasi were able to guide me through some of the loops that did not make much sense. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the project.
